# Naming Convention for UI Components in Next.js with Tailwind CSS

A clear and consistent naming convention is crucial for efficient collaboration, maintainability, and organization of your UI components. Here's a proposed naming convention for your Next.js application using Tailwind CSS:

- Prefix all components with 'UI' to indicate that they are part of the UI folder.
- Use camelCase for naming components, starting with a capital letter for easier readability.
- Separate the component's purpose from its appearance using a double hyphen (--).
- Use descriptive names that convey the component's purpose and appearance.

Here's a list of suggested component names for a modern web application:

- UIButton--Primary: Primary button with the main call-to-action styling.
- UIButton--Secondary: Secondary button with a less prominent appearance.
- UIInput--Text: Text input field for user input.
- UIInput--Checkbox: Checkbox input for selection and toggling.
- UIInput--Radio: Radio button input for mutually exclusive options.
- UIInput--Dropdown: Dropdown menu for selecting one option from a list.
- UIInput--Textarea: Multi-line text input field.
- UICard--Standard: Standard card component for displaying information or media.
- UICard--Horizontal: Horizontal card component for displaying information or media.
- UICard--Vertical: Vertical card component for displaying information or media.
- UIModal--Standard: Standard modal window for displaying content or forms.
- UINavbar--Top: Top navigation bar component for main site navigation.
- UINavbar--Sidebar: Sidebar navigation component for secondary navigation.
- UIPagination--Standard: Pagination component for navigating through multiple pages.
- UIList--Ordered: Ordered list component for displaying a list with numbering.
- UIList--Unordered: Unordered list component for displaying a list with bullets.

- UITable--Standard: Standard table component for displaying tabular data.
- UITable--Striped: Striped table component for easier readability of tabular data.

This naming convention clearly separates the purpose and appearance of the components, making it easy to understand and use within your Next.js application.
